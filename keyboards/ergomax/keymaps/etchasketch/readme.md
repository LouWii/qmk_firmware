# The etch-a-sketch keymap for Ergomax

The ProMicro used on Ergomax rev1 has 2 pins free that can be used for anything. In this keymap, we wire them to a rotary encoder, one on each side. The rest of the keymap is based on the default keymap.

The 2 encoders are mapped to mouse directions, making it work just like an etch-a-sketch.
