# Louwii-Pad

Louwii-Pad is just a custom controller I built for myself. The goal is to make it flexible enough to be efficient in multiple programs. The idea is to have one layer per program/workflow.

Keyboard Maintainer: [LouWii](https://github.com/louwii)

Hardware Supported: Louwii-Pad PCB (based on ATmega32u4)
